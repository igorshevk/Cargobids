# Getting Started

## Python Library Requirements
To ensure the correct python libraries are setup for this project setup a python virtual environment and activate it.

For this project i have used `python 3`, and you would need pipenv to install the requirements.

To install `pipenv` globally use the following command

```
sudo pip3 install pipenv
```

Then run from the root directory run the following command
```
pipenv install
```

This will install all libraries required by this project.

##Database
#### msqlclient :
When trying to perform `runserver` command, you will face error for mysqldb or mysqlclient.

To install mysql client you can use the following commands, usually in most systems this following command will give error.
######`Do not Copy "$" when copying commpands. It is just representation that this is a standalone command`
```
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

$ pip install mysqlclient
```

If the above commands gave error, then you can go to the following url, and download the suitable mysqlclient for your machine.

```

```

Such as I have python 3.6, so for me i have downloaded the `.whl` file and used this following command from inside my virtualenv

```
pip install mysqlclient-1.4.6-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
```


#### Migrations :
You can use the following commands to make and run migrations


```
$ python manage.py makemigrations

$ python manage.py migrate
```




## .env setup
I have used the following package for .env
I have kept `.env.example` in under `cargobids/cargobids/` directory, modify it according to your environment and rename it to .env
